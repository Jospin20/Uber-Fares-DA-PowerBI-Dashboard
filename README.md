Uber Fares Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard
Project Overview:
This project analyzes taxi trip data using Python for data cleaning and feature engineering, followed by interactive visualization in Power BI. The goal is to uncover fare patterns, ride durations, and operational insights through an enhanced dataset and a comprehensive dashboard.

Repository Contents:
1. taxi_enhanced.csv = Cleaned and feature-engineered dataset used for Power BI visualizations

2. PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix = The interactive Power BI dashboard file with all required visuals and slicers

3. Taxi_Enhanced_PBI_Report.docx = Detailed analytical report describing methodology, findings, and recommendations

4. Screenshots = Folder containing screenshots documenting data loading, cleaning, DAX formulas (if any), and dashboard creation stages

Data Source
The original dataset was sourced from Kaggle's Uber Fares dataset, cleaned and enhanced as part of this project.

Features and Analysis:
1.Fare distribution patterns and outlier detection

2.Trip volume by hour and day of the week

3.Peak vs off-peak trip comparisons

4.Relationship between trip distance and fare amount
